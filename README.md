- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mohammad Firoj Haider. I go by my middle name, FIROJ. I am a father, husband and coder. Sometime, I work on my pet projects after 
     performing family duties as a father and husband. Github projects are my pet projects. 
     Most of the projects are not done completely because of long vacation. I am trying to catch up.  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web application programming. In my day job, I use Java, JBoss/WildFly, SQL and JavaScript last but not least Git. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular and Godot. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by myappworld114 at gmail.com.
